# Testing Rules for TaskTracker Home Assistant Integration

## Always check your directory and vitrualenv

**CRITICAL:** Always ensure you are in the `tasktracker-hass-integration` directory
**CRITICAL:** Always ensure you have activate the tasktracker-hass-integration virtualenv with the `source .venv/bin/activate` command.

## Always Use the run_tests.py Helper Script

**CRITICAL:** Always use the `run_tests.py` helper script to run tests instead of running pytest directly. This script:
- Checks for required test dependencies
- Runs pytest with proper coverage configuration
- Provides clear error messages for missing dependencies
- Generates HTML coverage reports

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Installing Test Dependencies
If tests fail due to missing dependencies, install them first:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Handling Version Compatibility Issues
If you encounter version compatibility issues with `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` (especially requiring Python 3.13+), try:
1. Use a compatible version: `pip install pytest-homeassistant-custom-component==0.13.205`
2. Or install without the specific version constraintand

### Test Structure
- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Use `pytest` fixtures and patterns consistent with Home Assistant testing
- Mock external API calls using `aioresponses`
- Test both success and error scenarios for all service calls

## DO NOT:
- Run `pytest` directly without using `run_tests.py`
- Install test dependencies globally if using a virtual environment
- Skip testing after making changes to service functions
- Ignore test dependency version conflicts

## Coverage Reports
The test runner automatically generates:
- Terminal coverage report
- HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/index.html`

Always check coverage reports to ensure new code is properly tested.
